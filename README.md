## Inspiration
*We all have a need for Instant delivery from our favorite near-by store ;)*  

In our life, we have a vacuum of having instant delivery from our known neighbourhood shops.
###Imagine
*You are enjoying cricket on a hot Sunday afternoon in the comfort of your home, Naturally you will have an urge to eat snacks and drink beverages then you want someone to bring the goodies to you from your near-by and known shops under 5-10 mins.
*You are in the middle of making a special dish , suddenly you realise that you don't have some ingredients 
then you want someone to bring the required materials to you from your near-by and known shops under 5-10 mins.
*You are not feeling well or you don't have your prescribed medicines then you want someone to bring the meds to you from your near-by chemists shop within 5-10 mins.  
  
*Mohalla* will make it possible !!

## What it does
This App is like going to your neighbourhood shops to place your order and getting it at your step door, but the best thing is  "going to shop" part is NOT NEEDED !!  

*Mohalla* gives users the interface where she/he can fill her/his cart, and then gives options (if there are) of vendors who are available to provide items in the cart and are under a 1 km radius from the user's location and let the user decide the vendor from whom he/she wants to order.
The App will also provide additional information such as the time it will take to deliver and the distance between the shop and the residence of user to him. Thus the items will be delivered to the user by local delivery people in given time.

## How we built it
The layout and looks of the App were designed using Canva.
The App was built using Java Language on Android Studio.
## Challenges we ran into
*As a team having only freshers, it was our 1st hand on many kinds of stuff, like*  

 Taking OTP from User, Storing user data on firebase, Fragment nuances were very new to us and Recycler view in fragments.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Working together as team is one of the best parts of this project. 

## What we learned
*There are so many things we learned while working on this project.*
We learnt to effectively use many stuff on android such as firebase , fragment,etc.
## What's next for Mohalla
*There are so many things in mind for the improvement of the App but due to lack of time, working skills, and experience we haven't done much of what we aimed for.*  

*For purchasing medicines, we want to add a feature so that the users can upload his/her prescription and the meds can be provided accordingly.
*Automatic location detection using Google Maps.
*The User Interface can be improved further.
